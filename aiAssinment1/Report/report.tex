\section{Chapter One}
\label{sec:orgc87e144}
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgd68c741}
During my internship period, I work as Full-stack developer. My duty is to
develop a royalty and promotion system. The system consist 2 parts, one is
the android and ios application running on customers mobile device. They can
use the application to favorite the shops and get royalty points. What's more
they can also receive the E-stamps and get the new promotion notifications.
Another part is a AdminDashboard for the shop holders. They can use this to
add the new customers to their loyalty system and group them to distribute
the e-stamps, e-vouchers and push the promotion notifications.
\subsection{Background}
\label{sec:orga368f14}

I decide to use the most baised framework metoer witch have the most fastest
develop speed,so the can test the prototype easily,and make changes,and we use
the mongodb cause it is not schema based that means we can change the database
structure easilily and have the less side effect,despire we have to create the
customize schema on application level on my own .

The learning curve is good,first I do the 3 todo app on the official web and I
found the react version is more suitable for  the project cause in the future we
need the mobile version on android and ios so the react native is a better
choice.So build the react to our skill stack will save the future.

I need to develop the ios app,so I can not skip the mac os.But not all my notebook is mac to I need a stable system to develop the backend and frontend of the system.I used to be a Arch Linux user but It is just a platform for play with the linux, the community is quite ambicious.They always take the most latest as the rolling distribution.Another popular choice is geetoo wich also very clean.But the geetoo is souce based rather than binary based compared to arch which means the you can control the compiling process on you own so you need a high proformeance computer.

So I use elementary OS witch is based on ubuntu but it more like mac OS.The installing is very easy.Follow the official and you will get it easily.
I decide to choose a editor for my life change.The choice is firstly vim and then change to the nvim for the better economy of the synchronized api which makes the editor much faster and never block the ui.

I list all the all thins I used to create the application from front-end to
backend.

\section{Chapter Two}
\label{sec:orge1da213}
\subsection{Team Work}
\label{sec:orgee16887}
We use Github as the version control system to do the team work. We do the
different parts together and merge it to a single files. We use the github
branch to manage the new feature testing and gh-pages page to use the gihub
page to make documentation.
\subsection{Mobile Application}
\label{sec:orgc5cabec}
It is the Android and Ios application running on customers \hyperref[fig:org606d639]{\emph{mobile device}}. They can
use the application to \hyperref[fig:orgedc7f17]{\emph{favorite the shops and get royalty points}}. What's more
they can also receive the E-stamps and get the new promotion notifications.

\subsection{Self explore}
\label{sec:orgf98fa74}
I did learn a lot from this internship. Cause it is the first time I am
in charge of a huge project and explore every things the frameworks extra.
So I will talk more on this in different respect.
\subsubsection{Literate writing}
\label{sec:orgc2d442b}
When I start to write documentation, I pay a lot of attention to the iterate
writing. This kind of skills set help me to write documentations, reports,
and academic papers a lots. Because you can write code when you write things
and it gives you a lot of efficiency. I use this skills to write this
reports. The tables of content and the table, figures graphs all
auto-generate. And you can do more. You can find a demo in
\hyperref[fig:org8850b04]{Python Plot}

\begin{verbatim}
import pylab as pl
from numpy import sin, pi, linspace
t = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100)
pl.plot(t, sin(t))
pic = 'img/myfig.png'
pl.savefig(pic)
return 'img/myfig.png'
\end{verbatim}

\url{}
\subsubsection{Category theory}
\label{sec:org8f13b47}
During the last month, I pay a lot time to learn the category mathematics.
Because I find myself lack of this kind of knowledge since I am a electronic
student not computer science. While I decide to be a programmer in the
future. I love programming and I find the category theory help me a lot to
build real world model to a software model.

\section{Chapter Three}
\label{sec:org3c21cce}
\subsection{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{sec:org2bd2122}
I explore a lot good stuff during the internship, and make lots of life change
movement. Below show all my tools chains and they working together fantastic.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

I did love and enjoy the key-bindings of vim, from the day I switch from the emacs, but I switch back shortly because of the 2 main reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Emacs plugins works on my windows but the my vim got some problem and I have to dirty my configuration files so much to fixed.
\item I need to use playframework for development and the emacs support ensime very well.
\end{enumerate}

I move from emacs to vim then to neovim and now I am using the spacemacs, I think the configuration for everyone will become the same after long period of learning and copying from others, so it is good to give the community driven software a try.

Besides that, I also earn lots of the develop experience in the web area. And I
have the confidence to do well in the final year project.
